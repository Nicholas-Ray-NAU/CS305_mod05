# CS305_mod05

This repository stores a project that I completely made up. The code found within this repository are the drivers required to pilot a spaceship. This ship is capable of FTL travel, therefore code must be extremely efficient and error-free. Any bugs found on my spaceship must be squished immediately, coding errors included.
